# Sepsis Protocol Implementation Plan v2

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive sepsis management protocol across 3 hospital sites with integrated training and monitoring systems.

## Current State Analysis
- Existing sepsis protocols are paper-based and inconsistent across sites
- No real-time monitoring of protocol adherence
- Training is ad-hoc and not standardized
- Metrics collection is manual and delayed

## Desired End State
A fully digital, standardized sepsis protocol with:
- Real-time protocol guidance at point of care
- Automated adherence monitoring
- Integrated training modules
- Live dashboards for quality metrics

### Key Success Metrics
- Protocol adherence rate > 90%
- Time to antibiotics < 1 hour in 95% of cases
- All staff trained within 30 days
- Zero protocol-related adverse events

## What We're NOT Doing
- Not replacing existing EHR systems
- Not implementing AI-based diagnosis
- Not changing core clinical guidelines
- Not rolling out to more than 3 sites initially

## Implementation Approach
Phased rollout with training-first approach, starting with pilot site, then expanding to remaining sites with continuous monitoring.

## Phase 1: Pilot Site Setup (Site A)

### Overview
Deploy complete system at Site A with intensive training and support.

### Changes Required

#### 1. Digital Protocol System
**Component**: Protocol Engine
**Changes**: Deploy sepsis protocol decision support system

- Install protocol engine on hospital network
- Configure sepsis-specific pathways
- Integrate with existing monitoring systems
- Set up alert mechanisms

#### 2. Training Program
**Component**: Staff Training
**Changes**: Complete training for all Site A clinical staff

- Conduct 4-hour training sessions for all shifts
- Provide hands-on practice with protocol system
- Distribute quick reference guides
- Establish super-user support team

#### 3. Monitoring Dashboard
**Component**: Quality Metrics Dashboard
**Changes**: Deploy real-time monitoring system

- Install dashboard on clinical workstations
- Configure key metrics (time to antibiotics, bundle completion)
- Set up automated reporting
- Establish daily review process

### Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification
- [ ] Protocol system responds to test cases correctly
- [ ] Dashboard displays real-time data
- [ ] Alert system triggers appropriately
- [ ] Integration tests pass with monitoring systems

#### Manual Verification
- [ ] All clinical staff (n=45) complete training
- [ ] Protocol system accessible from all clinical areas
- [ ] Dashboard visible and understandable to clinical teams
- [ ] Super-users can troubleshoot common issues

**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Expansion to Site B

### Overview
Replicate successful Site A deployment at Site B with lessons learned.

### Changes Required

#### 1. System Deployment
**Component**: Protocol Engine
**Changes**: Deploy to Site B infrastructure

- Adapt configuration for Site B network
- Integrate with Site B monitoring systems
- Customize for Site B workflows
- Deploy alert mechanisms

#### 2. Training Rollout
**Component**: Staff Training
**Changes**: Train Site B clinical staff

- Conduct training sessions (adapted based on Site A feedback)
- Leverage Site A super-users as trainers
- Provide site-specific quick reference guides
- Establish Site B super-user team

#### 3. Monitoring Setup
**Component**: Quality Metrics Dashboard
**Changes**: Deploy monitoring for Site B

- Install dashboard on Site B workstations
- Configure site-specific metrics
- Set up comparative reporting (Site A vs Site B)
- Establish review process

### Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification
- [ ] Protocol system operational at Site B
- [ ] Dashboard displays Site B data correctly
- [ ] Alert system functional
- [ ] Cross-site reporting works

#### Manual Verification
- [ ] All Site B clinical staff (n=38) complete training
- [ ] Protocol system accessible from all Site B clinical areas
- [ ] Dashboard meets Site B team needs
- [ ] Super-users operational

**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful before proceeding to Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Final Site Rollout (Site C) and System-Wide Monitoring

### Overview
Complete rollout to Site C and establish system-wide monitoring and continuous improvement process.

### Changes Required

#### 1. Site C Deployment
**Component**: Protocol Engine
**Changes**: Deploy to Site C

- Deploy protocol system to Site C
- Integrate with Site C infrastructure
- Configure for Site C workflows
- Activate alert system

#### 2. Site C Training
**Component**: Staff Training
**Changes**: Train Site C staff

- Conduct training sessions
- Use experienced super-users from Sites A & B
- Provide site-specific materials
- Establish Site C super-user team

#### 3. System-Wide Monitoring
**Component**: Enterprise Dashboard
**Changes**: Deploy consolidated monitoring

- Create enterprise-wide dashboard
- Configure cross-site comparative metrics
- Set up automated monthly reports
- Establish quarterly review process

#### 4. Continuous Improvement Process
**Component**: Quality Improvement
**Changes**: Establish ongoing optimization

- Create feedback collection mechanism
- Schedule monthly cross-site meetings
- Implement protocol update process
- Establish annual review cycle

### Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification
- [ ] Protocol system operational at Site C
- [ ] Enterprise dashboard aggregates all 3 sites
- [ ] Automated reports generate correctly
- [ ] All integration tests pass

#### Manual Verification
- [ ] All Site C clinical staff (n=42) complete training
- [ ] Protocol system accessible across all sites
- [ ] Enterprise dashboard provides actionable insights
- [ ] Continuous improvement process operational
- [ ] All success metrics achieved (>90% adherence, <1hr antibiotics, etc.)

**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that the manual testing was successful and all system-wide metrics are achieved.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Protocol decision logic accuracy
- Alert trigger conditions
- Dashboard data calculations
- Integration endpoints

### Integration Tests
- EHR data flow
- Monitoring system integration
- Cross-site data aggregation
- Reporting pipeline

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Simulate sepsis case at each site
2. Verify protocol guidance accuracy
3. Confirm alert delivery
4. Validate dashboard metrics
5. Test reporting functionality
6. Verify training completion tracking

## Performance Considerations
- Protocol system response time < 2 seconds
- Dashboard refresh rate: real-time (< 30 seconds lag)
- Support 50 concurrent users per site
- 99.9% uptime requirement

## Migration Notes
- Parallel run with paper protocols for first 2 weeks at each site
- Data migration not required (fresh start)
- Existing metrics will be baseline for comparison
- Gradual transition of reporting from manual to automated
