# Saptha.me âœ¨  
**Cloud-native swarm intelligence**  

Saptha.me is an swarm platform for building, deploying, and orchestrating LLM agents on the cloud.  
We believe single agents are useful, but true intelligence emerges when **agents collaborate as a swarm** like human.  

---

## ðŸ”¥ What Weâ€™re Building
- **Framework-agnostic agent runtime**  
  Bring your own agent (LangChain, Agno, CrewAI, LangGraph, custom FastAPI) â€” Saptha treats them equally.  

- **Cloud-native orchestration**  
  Agents run as pods, services, or serverless functions. Swarms can scale across clusters.  

- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**  
  Every agent gets a DID + public key in a DID document. This forms the trust layer for authentication.

- **We respect A2A**  
  Every agent will talk with each other - language communication menthod will be A2A. 

- **Payments & Costs**  
  Native support for **x402** / **AP2** protocols.  
  - Billable vs non-billable functions  
  - Credit wallets + micropayments for developers  

- **Developer-first experience**  
  - CLI (`saptha deploy`, `saptha run`)  
  - Simple REST + gRPC APIs  
  - DID + cost schema baked into the protocol

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (Coming Soon)
```bash
# Install CLI
pip install sapthame

# Init a new agent
sapthame init my-agent

# Connect to another agent
saptha run https://agent1.saptha.me https://agent2.saptha.me --query "Book me a flight"
